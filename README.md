# EasyBank Landing Page

This is my solution for the [EasyBank landing page challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/easybank-landing-page-WaUhkoDN) on Frontend Mentor. Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out a landing page for a fictional online banking platform called EasyBank. The design is provided in both mobile and desktop versions, and the goal is to make the page look as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My approach

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to complete this challenge. I also used Sass as a CSS preprocessor and BEM as a naming convention for better organization and readability of my code.

I used flexbox and grid for layout, and media queries for responsiveness. I also added some subtle animations and transitions to make the page more interactive.

For the mobile navigation, I used JavaScript to toggle a class that shows and hides the menu. I also added an event listener to close the menu when clicking outside of it.

## How to run

To run this project locally, you can clone this repository and open the index.html file in your browser. Alternatively, you can use a live server extension if you are using VS Code or a similar code editor.

## Feedback

I enjoyed working on this challenge and I learned a lot from it. I would love to hear any feedback or suggestions on how I can improve my code or my design skills.
